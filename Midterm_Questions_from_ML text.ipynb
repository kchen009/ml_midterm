    "Create 30 non-trivial multiple choice problems, 5 from each chapter 1-6. Each question should have 4 options. None of the options should be obviously correct or obviously wrong. The question should test an idea in the material. Each question should be for a different sub-section. You should have at least 5 questions for each chapter. None of the questions should come from the intro section of any chapter. Each student is makeing one post in this forum. Before you submit, please look at others posts. You should not repeat a question someone else posted. Since you can edit, you may post your chapter 1 questions, then add chapter 2, etc. so that you don't have to go back and re-edit. "
